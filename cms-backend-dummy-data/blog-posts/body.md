Patients, doctors, and staff of the top Sylhet hospital are in tremendous crisis today as floodwater submerged the
hospital's ground floor, and electricity connection was cut off.
Shishir Ranjan Chakraborty, vice principal at Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College, said that there was knee-deep water on
the ground floor of the hospital. Considering this situation, the patients from the ground floor were shifted to the
first floor.
He said there was no electricity. The main generator was not working as water entered the generator room in the ground
floor.
Patients are being treated using candles from this noon as electricity connection was cut off all over the district,
said Shishir Ranjan Chakraborty, also the head of medicine department of the hospital.
Three alternative generators have been brought in on an urgent basis. Efforts are being made to run the operation
theatre and Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the doctor added.
Geeta Das, who came with another patient, said, "My husband is admitted to this hospital. I came from the ground floor
to the first floor. I am wondering whether the patient will be moved somewhere else again."

The Selecao breezed through South American World Cup qualifying, topping their group after going unbeaten before the
rearranged clash with Argentina on September 22.

Argentina are another force to be reckoned in the battle for the famous Jules Rimet trophy, having gone undefeated in 33
games â€“ the longest intact unbeaten run in international football.

Holders France are also among the contenders, while England, Spain and Germany will be expected to provide stern
competition at world football's showpiece event.

Roberto Carlos was in the team that won Brazil's fifth and most recent World Cup in 2002, and he believes Tite's side
will end a 20-year wait to be crowned champions in December.

"The most important thing is that Brazil have a great team," he told reporters. "It's time to win, because the last
photo we have is ours [in 2002].

"I am very optimistic. It is not easy to win a World Cup. In recent times, the Brazilian team are as usual, since our
time, they have played great games, but have never been so good.

"The Copa America is important but for the Brazilians, this World Cup is going to be very important and has a special
flavour, the moment of the national team is very good.

"At least the European press put Brazil as one of the favourites. This is already an important factor.

"Luis Enrique commented on it the other day, if you ask any other national team coach, the Brazilian team is one of the
four favourites for this World Cup. If they prepare well, Brazil will win again."

Brazil start their World Cup campaign against Serbia on November 24, with clashes against Switzerland and Cameroon to follow in Group G.
